# Luke's dmenu

This is just my build of dmenu. Nothing special, don't bother starring ;-)

Only changes are minor config ones: bigger font and different colors.

The only reason this is even on Github is so LARBS can get to it.

## Installation

After making any config changes that you want, but `make`, `sudo make install` it.
